On July 15, 2022, hundreds of former students of Mary and Richard Eichenberger performed at the Florissant Civic Center to raise funds for a scholarship in their honor. The concert was a rousing success!

And now we are pleased to announce the date for the next concert benefitting the Mary & Ike Eichenberger Music Scholarship...mark your calendars for Friday, July 19th 2024!
